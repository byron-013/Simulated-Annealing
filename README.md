# Simulated-Annealing
File with Simulated Annealing file and its implementation to solve the Traveling salesman problem.
This Python-based project demonstrates a deep understanding of optimization algorithms and their applications in solving complex problems. The program uses the concept of Simulated Annealing, a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. In this case, it’s applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research.

The program begins by modeling the TSP, which involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the origin city. It’s a problem that has implications in routing, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips; hence, it’s a practical demonstration of applying data science in real-world scenarios.

The Simulated Annealing algorithm is then used to solve the modeled problem. This algorithm is particularly suitable for this task because of its ability to avoid getting trapped in local optima in search of the global optimum. It does this by initially accepting worse solutions at a high “temperature”, emulating the annealing process of slowly cooling a material to decrease defects and increase the size of the crystal lattice structure.

The program also showcases the ability to create and interpret sophisticated data visualizations. The 3D plots generated by the program represent the paths taken by the traveling salesman, with different colors indicating distinct paths. An overlaid line graph likely represents a metric over iterations or time, providing insights into the performance and convergence of the algorithm.
